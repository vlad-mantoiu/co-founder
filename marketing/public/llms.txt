# Co-Founder.ai

> Co-Founder.ai is an AI technical co-founder for non-technical founders. It analyzes your product requirements, designs architecture, writes production code, runs tests, and prepares deployment-ready changes — without equity, contracts, or a hiring process.

Co-Founder.ai is made by GetInsourced (https://getinsourced.ai). It is not a no-code builder or a freelancer marketplace. No-code tools like Bubble or Webflow give you drag-and-drop to build things yourself. Co-Founder.ai is different: it thinks through product decisions with you, generates architecture plans, and writes the actual code. You stay in control through review and approval; it handles the engineering. The closest comparison is hiring a technical co-founder or CTO — Co-Founder.ai provides the same senior-level execution without the equity negotiation or recruiting process.

## How It Differs from Alternatives

Co-Founder.ai is not a development agency (no retainer, no account management, no 6-week timelines). It is not a no-code builder (you are not building anything yourself). It is not a freelancer marketplace (no hiring, no interviews, no handoffs). The correct comparison is: hiring a technical co-founder who works 24/7, never loses context, costs $99-$999/month instead of 15-25% equity, and starts immediately.
