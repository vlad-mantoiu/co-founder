### 7 Specific Cross-Phase Checks

| # | Check | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Marketing build pipeline chains correctly (next-sitemap → convert-images → validate-jsonld) | WIRED |
| 2 | JSON-LD accumulation — no conflicts or duplicates across 3 pages (9 total schemas) | CLEAN |
| 3 | CSS layering — hero-fade + splash overlay + shimmer animations no selector conflicts | CLEAN |
| 4 | Root layout composition — metadataBase + SplashScreen + pre-hydration script + JSON-LD in correct order | VERIFIED |
| 5 | Deploy pipeline — two-pass S3 sync doesn't break sitemap/robots.txt/llms.txt | WIRED |
| 6 | robots.txt — Phase 24 generated, Phase 27 extended with AI bot policies — compose correctly | COMPOSED |
| 7 | PageContentWrapper — Phase 25 pattern works with Phase 27 new sections | WIRED |

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| First visit: splash → dismiss → content with hero-fade | Complete |
| Repeat visit: no splash → skeleton → crossfade → content | Complete |
| Page navigation: progress bar → skeleton → crossfade | Complete |
| Social sharing: OG image + title + description preview | Complete |
| SEO crawl: sitemap → robots.txt → canonical URLs → JSON-LD | Complete |
| AI crawl: robots.txt AI bots → llms.txt → FAQPage JSON-LD | Complete |
| Build pipeline: next build → postbuild chain → validate → deploy | Complete |

## Text Discrepancies (Documented, Not Gaps)

| Req | Text Says | Implementation Does | Resolution |
|-----|-----------|--------------------|----|
| PERF-02 | `display: swap` | `display: block` | Both eliminate FOUT; `block` chosen intentionally in Phase 23 |
| SEO-10 | "with SearchAction" | No SearchAction | Site has no search; Phase 22 documented decision |
| GEO-01 | "(pricing, homepage)" | /cofounder + /pricing | Requirements mislabeled /cofounder as "homepage" |

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 26 | srcset generation not implemented (no images exist yet) | Low |
| 26 | CDK deploy needed for images/* CloudFront behavior | Low |
