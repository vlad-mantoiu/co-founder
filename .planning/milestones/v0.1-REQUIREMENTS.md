# Requirements: AI Co-Founder

**Defined:** 2026-02-16
**Core Value:** A non-technical founder can go from idea to running MVP preview in under 10 minutes, making product decisions the entire way.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Authentication & Workspace

- [ ] **AUTH-01**: Unauthenticated access blocked on all protected routes
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: Authenticated request returns dashboard shell (even if empty)
- [ ] **AUTH-03**: First login provisions user profile + workspace idempotently
- [ ] **AUTH-04**: Feature flags include `beta_features[]` with default gating

### Onboarding

- [ ] **ONBD-01**: Start onboarding session returns dynamic question set (LLM-tailored to founder's idea, stable schema)
- [ ] **ONBD-02**: Submit onboarding answers persists them and returns Thesis Snapshot
- [ ] **ONBD-03**: Onboarding can be resumed and is idempotent
- [ ] **ONBD-04**: Required fields enforced (target user, problem, constraint)
- [ ] **ONBD-05**: User isolation — users cannot access others' onboarding data

### Project & Idea Capture

- [ ] **PROJ-01**: Create project from idea returns `project_id`
- [ ] **PROJ-02**: Idea message is persisted and linked to project
- [ ] **PROJ-03**: Empty idea rejected with validation error
- [ ] **PROJ-04**: User isolation enforced (404/403 for other users' projects)

### Understanding Interview

- [ ] **UNDR-01**: Start understanding session returns structured questions (5–7, LLM-tailored)
- [ ] **UNDR-02**: Submitting answers produces Rationalised Idea Brief with stable schema (problem_statement, target_user, value_prop, differentiation, monetization_hypothesis, assumptions[], risks[], smallest_viable_experiment)
- [ ] **UNDR-03**: LLM failures handled with friendly error and debug_id
- [ ] **UNDR-04**: Brief is persisted and appears in project context/dashboard
- [ ] **UNDR-05**: User isolation enforced
- [ ] **UNDR-06**: Deep Research button stub returns 402/locked if not enabled

### Decision Gate 1

- [ ] **GATE-01**: Creating gate returns `decision_id` and options (Proceed/Narrow/Pivot/Park)
- [ ] **GATE-02**: Attempting to generate plan/build before decision returns 409 with message
- [ ] **GATE-03**: Choosing "Narrow" updates brief scope and logs decision
- [ ] **GATE-04**: Choosing "Pivot" creates new brief version and logs the pivot
- [ ] **GATE-05**: Choosing "Park" freezes project and blocks execution

- [ ] **DOCS-02**: Each artifact retrievable by ID (Product Brief, MVP Scope, Milestones, Risk Log, How It Works)
- [ ] **DOCS-03**: Artifacts are versioned (v1, v2)
- [ ] **DOCS-04**: Regeneration updates versions, not duplicates
- [ ] **DOCS-05**: User isolation enforced
- [ ] **DOCS-06**: Artifacts exportable as PDF
- [ ] **DOCS-07**: Artifacts exportable as Markdown

### Execution Plan

- [ ] **PLAN-01**: Execution plan generation returns 2–3 options with stable fields (name, time_to_ship, complexity, cost_note, tradeoffs[], recommended boolean)
- [ ] **PLAN-02**: Selection required before build starts (409 if missing)
- [ ] **PLAN-03**: Selection persisted and visible in Strategy Graph and Timeline
- [ ] **PLAN-04**: Beta gating for advanced options

### Generation Loop v0.1

- [ ] **GENR-01**: Start generation returns `job_id` and status queued/running
- [ ] **GENR-02**: Job progresses deterministically (scaffold → code → deps → checks → ready)
- [ ] **GENR-03**: Workspace contains expected files (README, env example, start script)
- [ ] **GENR-04**: E2B-hosted preview URL exists for running app
- [ ] **GENR-05**: Builds are versioned: build_v0_1, build_v0_2
- [ ] **GENR-06**: Failure sets job failed with helpful message and debug_id
- [ ] **GENR-07**: Idempotency: rerun creates new version without corrupting prior build

### MVP Built State

- [ ] **MVPS-01**: When build_v0_1 is ready, stage transitions to MVP Built
- [ ] **MVPS-02**: Dashboard shows product_version v0.1, MVP completion percent > 0, next milestone suggested
- [ ] **MVPS-03**: Timeline includes "MVP built" entry
- [ ] **MVPS-04**: Strategy graph marks MVP node completed

### Solidification Gate 2

- [ ] **SOLD-03**: Decision recorded and visible in timeline

### Iteration Plan

- [ ] **ITER-01**: Iteration plan references MVP build version and chosen goal
- [ ] **ITER-02**: Plan limits are explicit (max iterations, expected changes)
- [ ] **ITER-03**: Plan is recorded and appears in context

### Generation Loop v0.2

- [ ] **GENL-01**: Submit iteration request creates a Change Request artifact
- [ ] **GENL-02**: Patch applied to workspace deterministically
- [ ] **GENL-03**: Minimal check step runs; on fail, rollback or mark as needs-review
- [ ] **GENL-04**: build_v0_2 created; preview updated
- [ ] **GENL-05**: Timeline narrates change in plain English
- [ ] **GENL-06**: User isolation enforced

### Deploy Readiness

- [ ] **DEPL-01**: Deploy readiness endpoint returns readiness boolean, blocking issues list, recommended deploy path
- [ ] **DEPL-02**: Deploy action returns hosted deploy job ID OR precise deploy steps with secrets checklist
- [ ] **DEPL-03**: Access control enforced

### Company Dashboard

- [ ] **DASH-01**: Dashboard displays project_id, stage, product_version, mvp_completion_percent, next_milestone, risk_flags[], suggested_focus, latest_build_status, preview URL
- [ ] **DASH-02**: Dashboard renders as hybrid PM view (cards that drill down into rich documents)
- [ ] **DASH-03**: Empty states return empty arrays (not null)
- [ ] **DASH-04**: Dashboard updates reflect state machine transitions in real-time

### Strategy Graph

- [ ] **GRPH-01**: Graph nodes have id, type, title, status, created_at
- [ ] **GRPH-02**: Graph edges have from, to, relation
- [ ] **GRPH-03**: Node detail includes why, tradeoffs[], alternatives[], impact_summary
- [ ] **GRPH-04**: Graph backed by Neo4j with indexed queries

- [ ] **TIME-02**: Timeline rendered as Kanban board with statuses
- [ ] **TIME-03**: Tickets expandable for information and queryable

### Decision Console

- [ ] **DCSN-01**: Decision templates for Monetization Model, Pricing Structure, Checkout Strategy, Scope Narrowing, Build Path, Deploy Path
- [ ] **DCSN-02**: Each decision includes options[] with pros[], cons[], engineering_impact, time_to_ship, cost_note
- [ ] **DCSN-03**: Decisions recorded and acknowledged before execution begins

### State Machine

- [ ] **STMC-01**: Five stages: Thesis Defined, Validated Direction, MVP Built, Feedback Loop Active, Scale & Optimize (last out of MVP)
- [ ] **STMC-02**: Each stage has entered_at, exit_criteria[], progress_percent (0-100), blocking_risks[], suggested_focus
- [ ] **STMC-03**: Stage transitions only via decision gates
- [ ] **STMC-04**: Progress computed deterministically from completed artifacts/build status

### Worker Capacity

- [ ] **WORK-01**: Queue-based throughput limiting — work slows down, never halts
- [ ] **WORK-02**: Estimated wait messaging shown to user ("Processing... estimated N minutes")
- [ ] **WORK-03**: Max concurrent jobs per project enforced
- [ ] **WORK-04**: Iteration beyond cap requires explicit confirmation flag
- [ ] **WORK-05**: Per-user worker capacity tied to subscription tier

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full code editor in dashboard | Contradicts founder-first positioning; export to git for code editing |
| "Generate everything" button | Unfocused output; guided interview + phased generation is better |
| Real-time collaborative editing | Single-founder tool for MVP; team features are v2 |
| Unlimited free tier | AI generation is expensive; bounded tiers with worker capacity |
| Multi-framework support | Opinionated AI-chosen stack per idea; quality over breadth |
| Manual infrastructure management | Non-technical users don't want to configure AWS; abstracted hosting |
| Blockchain/Web3 features | Niche; focus on 90% use case (web apps) |
| 100% production-ready output | Position as MVP generator; "80% there" with handoff path |
| Custom domains for previews | E2B sandbox URLs sufficient for MVP |
| OAuth social login beyond Clerk | Clerk handles auth complexity already |
