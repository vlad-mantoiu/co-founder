# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** A non-technical founder can go from idea to running MVP preview in under 10 minutes, making product decisions the entire way.
**Current focus:** v0.3 Marketing Separation

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-19 — Milestone v0.3 started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v0.3 work:

- [v0.3]: Separate static marketing site on CloudFront + S3 — ClerkProvider adds ~200KB JS and forces dynamic SSR on marketing pages
- [v0.3]: Next.js static export (`output: 'export'`) for marketing site — same stack, monorepo at /marketing
- [v0.3]: Multi-product URL structure: getinsourced.ai/{product} — parent brand hosts multiple AI agent products
- [v0.3]: cofounder.getinsourced.ai root redirects to /dashboard (authed) or /sign-in (not authed) — no marketing on app domain

### Pending Todos

- [ ] Verify workflow_run gate: push a commit with a failing test and confirm deploy.yml does NOT trigger
- [ ] Verify path filtering: push a backend-only change and confirm deploy-frontend job is skipped in Actions UI

### Blockers/Concerns

(None for v0.3)
