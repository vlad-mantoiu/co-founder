# v0.6 Milestone Audit: Live Build Experience

**Audited:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** gaps_found
**Scores:** Requirements 9/47 | Phases 2/7 | Integration 9/9 | E2E Flows 0/2

## Executive Summary

The v0.6 milestone is **early in execution**. The infrastructure foundation (Phases 33-34) is solid — S3 bucket, CloudFront OAC, IAM grants, SSEEventType constants, feature flags, and ScreenshotService are all built, tested, and correctly wired to each other. However, 5 of 7 phases (35-39) have not been started, leaving 38 of 47 requirements unsatisfied. The milestone cannot be completed until all phases are executed.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Plans | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 33 | Infrastructure & Configuration | ✓ Complete | 3/3 | passed |
| 34 | ScreenshotService | ✓ Complete | 3/3 | passed |
| 35 | DocGenerationService | ✗ Not started | 0/TBD | — |
| 36 | GenerationService Wiring & API Routes | ✗ Not started | 0/TBD | — |
| 37 | Frontend Hooks | ✗ Not started | 0/TBD | — |
| 38 | Panel Components | ✗ Not started | 0/TBD | — |
| 39 | BuildPage Refactor & Completion State | ✗ Not started | 0/TBD | — |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied Requirements (9/47)

| Requirement | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|
| INFRA-01 | 33 | passed | 33-01 | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| INFRA-02 | 33 | passed | 33-01 | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| INFRA-03 | 33 | passed | 33-03 | `[ ]` | **satisfied** (checkbox stale) |
| INFRA-04 | 33 | passed | 33-02 | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| INFRA-05 | 33 | passed | 33-02 | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SNAP-01 | 34 | passed | 34-01, 34-02 | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SNAP-02 | 34 | passed | 34-01, 34-02, 34-03 | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SNAP-06 | 34 | passed | 34-01 | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SNAP-07 | 34 | passed | 34-01 | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

### Unsatisfied Requirements (38/47)

All mapped to unstarted phases:

| Category | Requirements | Phase | Count |
|----------|-------------|-------|-------|
| Documentation | DOCS-01, 02, 03, 07, 08 | 35 | 5 |
| Wiring & Narration | NARR-02, 04, 08, SNAP-03, DOCS-09 | 36 | 5 |
| Frontend Hooks | REAS-01, 02, 06, SNAP-04, 05 | 37 | 5 |
| Panel Components | NARR-01, 03, 05, 06, 07, DOCS-04, 05, 06, REAS-03, 04, 05, 07, LAYOUT-03 | 38 | 13 |
| Build Page & Completion | LAYOUT-01, 02, 04, COMP-01 thru 07 | 39 | 10 |

No orphaned requirements — all 47 are mapped to phases in the traceability table.

## Integration Check (Completed Phases Only)

**9/9 cross-phase connections verified** between Phases 33-34:

| Connection | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| CDK ScreenshotsStack → ComputeStack IAM/env | ✓ Wired |
| ECS env vars → pydantic Settings fields | ✓ Wired |
| Settings → ScreenshotService.capture() feature gate | ✓ Wired |
| SSEEventType.SNAPSHOT_UPDATED → screenshot_service.py | ✓ Wired |
| Redis hset snapshot_url → GenerationStatusResponse read | ✓ Wired |
| S3 key format → CloudFront distribution path | ✓ Wired |
| CacheControl header → CloudFront ResponseHeadersPolicy | ✓ Consistent |
| Dockerfile PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH → runtime binary | ✓ Wired |
| /docs endpoint receiver → future Phase 35 writer | ✓ Pre-wired |

**2 by-design deferrals** (not integration failures):
1. ScreenshotService not called from GenerationService → Phase 36
2. Frontend interface missing snapshot_url/docs_ready → Phase 37-38

**No regressions** to prior milestones (v0.1-v0.5).

## E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Break Point |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Screenshot capture → S3 → CloudFront → frontend display | ✗ Broken | Phase 36 wiring (service not called from build pipeline) |
| SSE snapshot.updated → frontend snapshot panel | ✗ Broken | Phase 37 hooks (frontend doesn't consume event) |

## Tech Debt (from prior milestones, non-blocking)

**Phase 13:** Missing @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators; test_understanding_service_real.py not created
**Phase 15:** ECS service names require human verification against live AWS
**Phase 33:** INFRA-03 checkbox in REQUIREMENTS.md stale (`[ ]` should be `[x]`)

## Human Verification Items (from prior phases)

6 phases have `human_needed` status with items requiring browser/live-site testing:
- Phase 14: Stripe webhook live status
- Phase 15: GitHub Actions CI gate
- Phase 17: GitHub Actions pipeline
- Phase 27: Google Rich Results Test
- Phase 30: Runtime visual verification (5 items)
- Phase 31: Browser/iframe verification (5 items)
