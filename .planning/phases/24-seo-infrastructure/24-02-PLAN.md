<objective>
Add complete per-page SEO metadata to all 8 marketing pages and move SoftwareApplication JSON-LD to the /cofounder page.

Purpose: Each page needs unique title, description, canonical URL, and OpenGraph tags for search engines and social sharing. The SoftwareApplication schema belongs on the product page (/cofounder), not the root layout, for more accurate structured data placement.

Output: All 8 pages with full SEO metadata exports using sharedOG spread pattern. SoftwareApplication JSON-LD rendered on /cofounder page.

    Update each page's metadata export to include title, description, alternates.canonical, and openGraph with sharedOG spread. Import `{ sharedOG, SITE_URL }` from `@/lib/seo` in each file.

    **CRITICAL:** Use trailing slashes on ALL canonical URLs (matches `trailingSlash: true` in next.config.ts).

    **CRITICAL:** Next.js metadata does shallow merging of openGraph. Every page that sets openGraph MUST spread `...sharedOG` to preserve images and siteName from the shared constant.

    **Per-page metadata (exact values from research):**

    **1. Homepage (`(marketing)/page.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    import type { Metadata } from 'next'
    import { sharedOG, SITE_URL } from '@/lib/seo'

    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      alternates: { canonical: `${SITE_URL}/` },
      openGraph: {
        ...sharedOG,
        title: 'GetInsourced — AI Co-Founder',
        description: 'AI technical co-founder that plans architecture, writes code, runs tests, and ships software for non-technical founders.',
        url: `${SITE_URL}/`,
      },
    }
    ```
    Note: Homepage does NOT set `title` or `description` at the page level — it uses root layout's `title.default` and `description`. Only `alternates` and `openGraph` are added.

    **2. Co-Founder (`cofounder/page.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'Co-Founder.ai',
      description: 'Co-Founder.ai: the AI that replaces your technical co-founder. Architecture, code, tests, and deployment — no equity required.',
      alternates: { canonical: `${SITE_URL}/cofounder/` },
      openGraph: {
        ...sharedOG,
        title: 'Co-Founder.ai | GetInsourced',
        description: 'Co-Founder.ai: the AI that replaces your technical co-founder. Architecture, code, tests, and deployment — no equity required.',
        url: `${SITE_URL}/cofounder/`,
      },
    }
    ```

    **3. How It Works (`cofounder/how-it-works/page.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'How It Works',
      description: 'See how Co-Founder.ai turns your idea into deployed software: define goals, generate architecture, review tested code, and ship.',
      alternates: { canonical: `${SITE_URL}/cofounder/how-it-works/` },
      openGraph: {
        ...sharedOG,
        title: 'How It Works | GetInsourced',
        description: 'See how Co-Founder.ai turns your idea into deployed software: define goals, generate architecture, review tested code, and ship.',
        url: `${SITE_URL}/cofounder/how-it-works/`,
      },
    }
    ```

    **4. Pricing (`pricing/page.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'Pricing',
      description: 'Simple, transparent pricing for Co-Founder.ai. Start free, upgrade as your product grows. No per-seat fees. Cancel anytime.',
      alternates: { canonical: `${SITE_URL}/pricing/` },
      openGraph: {
        ...sharedOG,
        title: 'Pricing | GetInsourced',
        description: 'Simple, transparent pricing for Co-Founder.ai. Start free, upgrade as your product grows. No per-seat fees. Cancel anytime.',
        url: `${SITE_URL}/pricing/`,
      },
    }
    ```

    **5. About (`about/page.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'About',
      description: 'We build AI that gives every non-technical founder access to a world-class technical co-founder. No equity split required.',
      alternates: { canonical: `${SITE_URL}/about/` },
      openGraph: {
        ...sharedOG,
        title: 'About | GetInsourced',
        description: 'We build AI that gives every non-technical founder access to a world-class technical co-founder. No equity split required.',
        url: `${SITE_URL}/about/`,
      },
    }
    ```

    **6. Contact (`contact/page.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'Contact',
      description: 'Have a question about Co-Founder.ai? Reach our team at hello@getinsourced.ai. We respond within 24 hours on business days.',
      alternates: { canonical: `${SITE_URL}/contact/` },
      openGraph: {
        ...sharedOG,
        title: 'Contact | GetInsourced',
        description: 'Have a question about Co-Founder.ai? Reach our team at hello@getinsourced.ai. We respond within 24 hours on business days.',
        url: `${SITE_URL}/contact/`,
      },
    }
    ```

    **7. Privacy (`privacy/page.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'Privacy Policy',
      description: 'Read the GetInsourced privacy policy. How we collect, use, and protect your data — including your source code and project files.',
      alternates: { canonical: `${SITE_URL}/privacy/` },
      openGraph: {
        ...sharedOG,
        title: 'Privacy Policy | GetInsourced',
        description: 'Read the GetInsourced privacy policy. How we collect, use, and protect your data — including your source code and project files.',
        url: `${SITE_URL}/privacy/`,
      },
    }
    ```

    **8. Terms (`terms/page.tsx`):**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'Terms of Service',
      description: 'Read the GetInsourced terms of service. Legal agreement governing your use of Co-Founder.ai and the GetInsourced platform.',
      alternates: { canonical: `${SITE_URL}/terms/` },
      openGraph: {
        ...sharedOG,
        title: 'Terms of Service | GetInsourced',
        description: 'Read the GetInsourced terms of service. Legal agreement governing your use of Co-Founder.ai and the GetInsourced platform.',
        url: `${SITE_URL}/terms/`,
      },
    }
    ```

    **Important notes:**
    - Preserve ALL existing imports and component code — only add/update the metadata export
    - If a page already has a metadata export, REPLACE it with the new version
    - For the homepage, DO NOT set `title` or `description` at page level — root layout defaults apply
    - For the contact page, the server wrapper already exists from Plan 01 — just update its metadata
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npx next build` passes
    - For each page: `grep 'alternates' src/app/(marketing)/{page}/page.tsx` — canonical URL present
    - For each page: `grep 'sharedOG' src/app/(marketing)/{page}/page.tsx` — OG spread present
    - Check built HTML: `grep 'canonical' out/index.html` — canonical link tag present
    - Check built HTML: `grep 'og:image' out/cofounder/index.html` — OG image tag present
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 8 pages have unique title, description, canonical URL with trailing slash, and openGraph with sharedOG spread. Build passes and HTML output contains correct meta tags.

  <name>Task 2: Move SoftwareApplication JSON-LD to /cofounder page</name>
  <files>
    marketing/src/app/(marketing)/cofounder/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Add the SoftwareApplication JSON-LD schema to the /cofounder page component. This was removed from root layout in Plan 01 and belongs semantically on the product page.

    In `cofounder/page.tsx`, wrap the existing component render with a fragment and add the JSON-LD script tag:

    ```typescript
    export default function CofounderPage() {
      return (
        <>
          <script
            type="application/ld+json"

              __html: JSON.stringify({
                '@context': 'https://schema.org',
                '@type': 'SoftwareApplication',
                name: 'Co-Founder.ai',

                  priceCurrency: 'USD',
                  description: 'Free tier available',
                },
                description: 'AI technical co-founder that plans architecture, writes code, runs tests, and prepares deployments for non-technical founders.',
                publisher: {

                  url: 'https://getinsourced.ai',
                },
              }),
            }}
          />
          <HomeContent />
        </>
      )
    }
    ```

    Note: Update publisher.name from "Insourced AI" to "GetInsourced" for brand consistency.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npx next build` passes
    - `grep 'SoftwareApplication' out/cofounder/index.html` — schema present in built HTML
    - `grep -c 'SoftwareApplication' src/app/layout.tsx` returns 0 (not in root layout)
    - `grep -c 'SoftwareApplication' src/app/(marketing)/cofounder/page.tsx` returns 1 (in product page)
  </verify>
  <done>
    SoftwareApplication JSON-LD is rendered on the /cofounder page with correct publisher name "GetInsourced". Root layout no longer contains this schema.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npx next build` — clean build
2. Check canonical on every page:
   ```bash
   for page in "" "cofounder/" "cofounder/how-it-works/" "pricing/" "about/" "contact/" "privacy/" "terms/"; do
     echo "=== $page ==="
     grep -o 'canonical.*"' "out/${page}index.html" | head -1
   done
   ```
3. Check OG image on non-root page: `grep 'og:image' out/pricing/index.html` — should have absolute URL
4. Check SoftwareApplication placement: `grep 'SoftwareApplication' out/cofounder/index.html` — present
5. Check no SoftwareApplication on homepage: `grep -c 'SoftwareApplication' out/index.html` returns 0
