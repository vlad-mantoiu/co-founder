<objective>
Add FAQPage JSON-LD to /pricing, update the pricing FAQ content to match user decisions, create llms.txt, configure AI crawler rules in robots.txt, and extend the build-time JSON-LD validation for both FAQ pages.

Purpose: Complete GEO-01 (pricing page FAQPage schema), deliver GEO-03 (llms.txt for AI crawler product description), deliver GEO-04 (explicit AI crawler allowances in robots.txt), and ensure the full build pipeline validates all new structured data. This plan depends on Plan 01 which added the /cofounder FAQPage content.

Output: Updated pricing page with new FAQ content + JSON-LD, llms.txt static file, updated next-sitemap config, extended validate-jsonld.mjs. Full build passes.

**1. Update the `faqs` array in pricing-content.tsx** to match user-specified pricing FAQ topics. Replace the existing 4 questions with 5 new questions covering value justification + plan selection (per user decisions). Export the array as `pricingFaqs` so pricing/page.tsx can import it for JSON-LD.

Rename `const faqs` to `export const pricingFaqs` and update the component reference from `faqs.map` to `pricingFaqs.map`.

New pricing FAQ content (5 questions, per user decisions — value justification + plan selection):

- "What's included in every Co-Founder.ai plan?" — All plans include an AI technical co-founder that analyzes your requirements, designs architecture, writes production code, runs tests, and prepares deployment-ready changes. You also get GitHub integration, sandbox execution, and 100% code ownership. Higher tiers add priority speed, Deep Memory, Nightly Janitor, and dedicated support.
- "How is Co-Founder.ai different from hiring a developer or agency?" — Position against hiring a CTO/agency (NOT no-code). A developer costs $15k-$40k/month with 6-12 week timelines, and a CTO takes 15-25% equity. Co-Founder.ai gives you the same senior-level execution starting at $99/month. Available 24/7, retains full context, and starts immediately — no recruiting, no contracts, no equity negotiation.
- "Which plan is right for me?" — The Bootstrapper ($99/month) is for solo founders validating an early-stage product — one project, standard speed. Autonomous Partner ($299/month) is for founders who need faster execution across multiple projects with Deep Memory and automated maintenance. CTO Scale ($999/month) is for teams running multi-agent workflows with enterprise needs.
- "Can I cancel anytime?" — Yes. No long-term contracts. Cancel anytime and keep access through your current billing period. Export all code and data before you leave. Your code is always 100% yours.
- "Who owns the code Co-Founder.ai generates?" — You do. Everything built by Co-Founder.ai belongs to you — code, assets, architecture, all of it. We never claim ownership. Your intellectual property is never used to train models.

Tone: Conversational but brief — friendly founder voice, 3-5 sentences per answer. Lead with what the founder gets.

**CRITICAL POSITIONING:** Position against hiring a CTO or agency, NOT against no-code builders. The value prop is a thinking partner that executes, not a tool you use yourself.

**2. Add FAQPage JSON-LD to pricing/page.tsx:**

Import `pricingFaqs` from pricing-content.tsx:
```typescript
import PricingContent, { pricingFaqs } from "@/components/marketing/pricing-content";
```

Add a JSON-LD script tag using the same `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` pattern:
```typescript
export default function PricingPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <script
        type="application/ld+json"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: JSON.stringify({
            '@context': 'https://schema.org',
            '@type': 'FAQPage',
            mainEntity: pricingFaqs.map(faq => ({
              '@type': 'Question',
              name: faq.q,
              acceptedAnswer: {
                '@type': 'Answer',
                text: faq.a,
              },
            })),
          }),
        }}
      />
      <PageContentWrapper skeleton={<ListSkeleton />}>
        <PricingContent />
      </PageContentWrapper>
    </>
  )
}
```

NOTE: The field names in the pricingFaqs array are `q` and `a` (matching the existing pattern in pricing-content.tsx), not `question` and `answer` like in cofounderFaqs. Map accordingly in the JSON-LD.

**IMPORTANT:** The import of `pricingFaqs` from a "use client" component into a server component works because it's a plain data export. If Next.js raises an error, move the `pricingFaqs` array to a separate shared file like `src/lib/faq-data.ts`.

**3. Create marketing/public/llms.txt:**

Static markdown file following the llmstxt.org spec (H1 title, blockquote summary, H2 sections). Content must include:
- Pricing tiers with actual dollar amounts (per user decision — so AI engines can answer "how much does it cost?")
- Competitive differentiators (per user decision — "How is this different?" section)
- Product page links

**CRITICAL POSITIONING:** Make clear Co-Founder is NOT a no-code builder. Position against hiring a CTO/agency.

Full content (adapt from research file's verified llms.txt example):

```markdown
# Co-Founder.ai

> Co-Founder.ai is an AI technical co-founder for non-technical founders. It analyzes your product requirements, designs architecture, writes production code, runs tests, and prepares deployment-ready changes — without equity, contracts, or a hiring process.

Co-Founder.ai is made by GetInsourced (https://getinsourced.ai). It is not a no-code builder or a freelancer marketplace. No-code tools like Bubble or Webflow give you drag-and-drop to build things yourself. Co-Founder.ai is different: it thinks through product decisions with you, generates architecture plans, and writes the actual code. You stay in control through review and approval; it handles the engineering. The closest comparison is hiring a technical co-founder or CTO — Co-Founder.ai provides the same senior-level execution without the equity negotiation or recruiting process.

## Product

- [Co-Founder.ai Product Overview](https://getinsourced.ai/cofounder/): What it is, how it works, and who it's for
- [How It Works](https://getinsourced.ai/cofounder/how-it-works/): Step-by-step process from idea to deployed code
- [Pricing Plans](https://getinsourced.ai/pricing/): All plans with current prices and feature details

## Pricing

**The Bootstrapper** — $99/month ($79/month billed annually)
For solo founders shipping and validating an early-stage product. Includes: 1 active project, standard build speed, GitHub integration, sandbox execution, basic session memory, community support.

**Autonomous Partner** — $299/month ($239/month billed annually) — Most popular
For founders who need faster execution with a full autonomous build loop. Includes: 3 active projects, priority build speed, Nightly Janitor (automated maintenance), Deep Memory (full context retention), messaging integration, priority support, custom deployment targets, automated testing suite.

**CTO Scale** — $999/month ($799/month billed annually)
For teams running multi-agent workflows with advanced control needs. Includes: unlimited projects, multi-agent workflows, VPC deployment option, dedicated support engineer, SOC2 compliance, custom integrations, SLA guarantee.

All plans: code ownership is 100% yours. No equity required. Cancel anytime.

## How It Differs from Alternatives

Co-Founder.ai is not a development agency (no retainer, no account management, no 6-week timelines). It is not a no-code builder (you are not building anything yourself). It is not a freelancer marketplace (no hiring, no interviews, no handoffs). The correct comparison is: hiring a technical co-founder who works 24/7, never loses context, costs $99-$999/month instead of 15-25% equity, and starts immediately.

  <name>Task 2: Configure AI crawler robots.txt rules + extend JSON-LD validation + verify build</name>
  <files>
    marketing/next-sitemap.config.js
    marketing/scripts/validate-jsonld.mjs
  </files>
  <action>
**1. Update next-sitemap.config.js** to add named AI bot policies and llms.txt reference:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next-sitemap').IConfig} */
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: 'https://getinsourced.ai',
  output: 'export',
  outDir: 'out',
  generateRobotsTxt: true,
  generateIndexSitemap: false,
  autoLastmod: true,
  changefreq: 'weekly',
  priority: 0.7,
  trailingSlash: true,
  exclude: ['/404', '/404/'],
  robotsTxtOptions: {
    policies: [
      { userAgent: '*', allow: '/' },
      { userAgent: 'GPTBot', allow: '/' },
      { userAgent: 'ClaudeBot', allow: '/' },
      { userAgent: 'PerplexityBot', allow: '/' },
      { userAgent: 'anthropic-ai', allow: '/' },
      { userAgent: 'OAI-SearchBot', allow: '/' },
      { userAgent: 'Google-Extended', allow: '/' },
    ],
    transformRobotsTxt: async (_config, robotsTxt) => {
      return robotsTxt + '\n# AI Context: https://getinsourced.ai/llms.txt\n'
    },
  },
}
```

This adds explicit named entries for GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot (required by SC-4), plus anthropic-ai, OAI-SearchBot, and Google-Extended for broader AI crawler coverage. All are set to `allow: '/'` per user decision (allow ALL AI crawlers including training crawlers). The `transformRobotsTxt` function appends an llms.txt comment at the end.

**IMPORTANT:** If `transformRobotsTxt` is not available in next-sitemap v4.2.3 (research flagged this as MEDIUM confidence), the build will still succeed — the named bot policies are the critical part. If the llms.txt comment doesn't appear in the generated robots.txt, that's acceptable — the comment is an emerging convention, not a requirement.

**2. Extend validate-jsonld.mjs** to validate FAQPage schema and expect it on both /cofounder and /pricing pages:

Add a `validateFAQPage` function:
```javascript
function validateFAQPage(schema, file) {
  if (!schema.mainEntity) {
    errors.push(`${file}: FAQPage missing 'mainEntity' (required)`)
    return
  }
  if (!Array.isArray(schema.mainEntity) || schema.mainEntity.length === 0) {
    errors.push(`${file}: FAQPage 'mainEntity' must be a non-empty array`)
    return
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < schema.mainEntity.length; i++) {
    const q = schema.mainEntity[i]
    if (q['@type'] !== 'Question') {
      errors.push(`${file}: FAQPage mainEntity[${i}] must have @type 'Question'`)
    }
    if (!q.name) {
      errors.push(`${file}: FAQPage mainEntity[${i}] missing 'name' (the question text)`)
    }
    if (!q.acceptedAnswer) {
      errors.push(`${file}: FAQPage mainEntity[${i}] missing 'acceptedAnswer'`)
    } else {
      if (q.acceptedAnswer['@type'] !== 'Answer') {
        errors.push(`${file}: FAQPage mainEntity[${i}].acceptedAnswer must have @type 'Answer'`)
      }
      if (!q.acceptedAnswer.text) {
        errors.push(`${file}: FAQPage mainEntity[${i}].acceptedAnswer missing 'text'`)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Update `pagesToValidate` to add FAQPage expectations:
```javascript
const pagesToValidate = [
  { path: 'index.html', expectedTypes: ['Organization', 'WebSite'] },
  { path: 'cofounder/index.html', expectedTypes: ['SoftwareApplication', 'FAQPage'] },
  { path: 'pricing/index.html', expectedTypes: ['FAQPage'] },
]
```

Add the FAQPage case to the switch statement:
```javascript
case 'FAQPage':
  validateFAQPage(schema, page.path)
  break
```

**3. Run the full build** to verify everything works end-to-end:
```bash
cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npm run build
```

This runs `next build` then postbuild (`next-sitemap && node scripts/convert-images.mjs && node scripts/validate-jsonld.mjs`). All three steps must pass.

**4. Verify the generated output files:**
- `out/robots.txt` contains User-agent entries for GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot
- `out/llms.txt` exists and contains the product description
- `out/cofounder/index.html` contains both SoftwareApplication and FAQPage JSON-LD
- `out/pricing/index.html` contains FAQPage JSON-LD
- validate-jsonld.mjs reports no errors
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npm run build` — full build including postbuild succeeds with zero errors. Verify:
1. `grep "GPTBot" marketing/out/robots.txt` returns a match
2. `grep "ClaudeBot" marketing/out/robots.txt` returns a match
3. `grep "PerplexityBot" marketing/out/robots.txt` returns a match
