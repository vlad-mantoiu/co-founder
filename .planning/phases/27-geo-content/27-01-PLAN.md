<objective>
Add the "What is Co-Founder.ai?" answer-format section and a FAQ section with FAQPage JSON-LD structured data to the /cofounder page.

Purpose: Make the /cofounder page citable by AI engines (7.75x citability lift from FAQPage schema) and provide visible answer-format content that satisfies Google Rich Results Test validation. The answer-format section addresses GEO-02 (direct answer content). The FAQ section + JSON-LD addresses GEO-01 for the /cofounder page.

Output: Updated home-content.tsx with two new sections (WhatIsSection, CofounderFaqSection) and updated cofounder/page.tsx with FAQPage JSON-LD.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add WhatIsSection and CofounderFaqSection to home-content.tsx</name>
  <files>marketing/src/components/marketing/home-content.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add two new section components to home-content.tsx and insert them into the HomeContent render order.

**1. Define a `cofounderFaqs` data array** at the top of the file (exported, so page.tsx can import it for JSON-LD). This array holds 4-5 FAQ items as `{ question: string, answer: string }[]`. Each entry is used for BOTH the visible FAQ accordion and the JSON-LD — keeping them in sync by construction.

FAQ content for /cofounder (per user decisions — mix of product understanding + objection handling):

- "What does Co-Founder.ai actually do?" — Definition: AI technical co-founder that thinks through product decisions WITH you, generates architecture, writes code, runs tests, prepares deployments. NOT a no-code builder where you still do the building. Position against hiring a CTO/agency: same senior-level execution without equity or recruiting.
- "Do I need technical skills to use it?" — No. Communicate in plain language. Describe what you want, the AI translates to technical decisions and code. You review and approve.
- "Is my idea safe with Co-Founder.ai?" — Yes. Code and data encrypted (TLS 1.3, AES-256). Never used to train models. SOC2-compliant infrastructure. Full export anytime.
- "How is this different from hiring a developer or agency?" — Position against CTO/agency (NOT no-code). No retainer, no 6-week timelines, no equity negotiation. Available 24/7, never loses context, costs $99-$999/month instead of 15-25% equity or $15k-$40k/month agency retainer. Starts immediately.
- "How long does it take to go from idea to MVP?" — Minutes for strategy, days for working code. The AI analyzes requirements, designs architecture, and starts building immediately. You stay in control through review and approval at every step.

Tone: Conversational but brief — friendly founder voice, 3-5 sentences per answer with personality. Lead with what the founder gets, not what the technology does.

**CRITICAL POSITIONING:** Co-Founder is NOT a no-code builder. Do NOT compare to Bubble/Webflow. Compare to hiring a CTO or agency. The value prop is "Go from idea to MVP strategy in 10 minutes, making product decisions the whole way" — a thinking partner, not a tool.

**2. Create `WhatIsSection` component** — a visible H2 section with the text "What is Co-Founder.ai?". Two paragraphs (6-8 sentences total) plus 2-3 bold callouts in a grid below.

- Paragraph 1 (definition): What Co-Founder.ai IS — an AI technical co-founder for non-technical founders. It analyzes requirements, designs architecture, writes production code, runs tests, and prepares deployment-ready changes. Unlike hiring a CTO or agency, no equity, no contracts, no 6-week timelines.
- Paragraph 2 (what you get): Concrete value — go from idea to MVP strategy in minutes. The AI thinks through product decisions with you, not just executes orders. Full context retention across sessions. 24/7 availability. You own 100% of the code.
- 3 bold callouts in a `sm:grid-cols-3` grid below the text. Each callout: bold title + brief description. Examples: "No Equity Required" / "24/7 Availability" / "Senior-Level Execution"

Use the existing design patterns: `FadeIn` wrapper, `section className="py-24 lg:py-32 border-t border-white/5"`, `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`, `text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight` for H2. Text colors: `text-white/70` for body, `text-white/45` for secondary text.

Placement: After `HeroSection` and `LogoTicker`, BEFORE `ComparisonSection`. This puts the definitional content high on the page for maximum GEO citation probability.

**3. Create `CofounderFaqSection` component** — an accordion-style FAQ section using the `<details>/<summary>` pattern already established in pricing-content.tsx. Renders the `cofounderFaqs` array. Use `FadeIn` wrapper with staggered delays per item (matching pricing page pattern). Section heading: "Frequently Asked Questions".

Style: Match pricing page FAQ exactly — `glass rounded-xl`, `group-open:rotate-45`, `+` icon, expand/collapse.

**4. Update HomeContent render order:**
```
<HeroSection />
<LogoTicker />
<WhatIsSection />        {/* NEW — GEO-02 */}
<ComparisonSection />
<FeatureGrid />
<HowItWorksSection />
<TestimonialSection />
<SecuritySection />
<CofounderFaqSection />   {/* NEW — GEO-01 visible FAQ */}
<CTASection />
```

The FAQ section goes near the bottom (before CTA) — same position as on /pricing. The answer-format section goes high (after LogoTicker, before Comparison) for early definitional content.

Run `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Visually verify `cofounderFaqs` is exported and contains 4-5 items. Verify `WhatIsSection` contains H2 "What is Co-Founder.ai?" with two paragraphs and 3 callouts. Verify `CofounderFaqSection` renders the FAQ accordion using `cofounderFaqs`. Verify HomeContent renders both new sections in the correct order.
  </verify>
  <done>home-content.tsx exports `cofounderFaqs` array, contains WhatIsSection (H2 + 2 paragraphs + 3 callouts) and CofounderFaqSection (accordion from cofounderFaqs), both rendered in HomeContent in the specified order. TypeScript compiles. All content positions against hiring a CTO/agency, not no-code builders.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add FAQPage JSON-LD to /cofounder/page.tsx</name>
  <files>marketing/src/app/(marketing)/cofounder/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add a FAQPage JSON-LD structured data script tag to cofounder/page.tsx, alongside the existing SoftwareApplication JSON-LD.

**1. Import `cofounderFaqs` from home-content.tsx:**
```typescript
import HomeContent, { cofounderFaqs } from "@/components/marketing/home-content";
```

**2. Add a second JSON-LD script tag** (after the existing SoftwareApplication one) using the same `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` pattern established in Phase 24:

```typescript
<script
  type="application/ld+json"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: JSON.stringify({
      '@context': 'https://schema.org',
      '@type': 'FAQPage',
      mainEntity: cofounderFaqs.map(faq => ({
        '@type': 'Question',
        name: faq.question,
        acceptedAnswer: {
          '@type': 'Answer',
          text: faq.answer,
        },
      })),
    }),
  }}
/>
```

Place this AFTER the SoftwareApplication script tag and BEFORE the `<PageContentWrapper>`. Both JSON-LD blocks remain in the server component layer (page.tsx) — this is required for Next.js static export.

**IMPORTANT:** The `cofounderFaqs` array is defined in the "use client" component (home-content.tsx) but the import in page.tsx (a server component) works because the array is a plain data export — not a React hook or client-only API. Next.js allows importing plain values from client components into server components. If this causes issues, move the `cofounderFaqs` array to a separate shared file like `src/lib/faq-data.ts` instead.

**3. Verify the JSON-LD uses the SAME data** as the visible FAQ section — both reference `cofounderFaqs`. This satisfies Google's content visibility requirement: all FAQ content in the schema is visible on the page.

Note: SC-1 means "Google Rich Results Test validates the schema as structurally correct (no errors)" — not that FAQ carousels will appear in Google SERP. Since August 2023, FAQ rich results are restricted to government/health sites. The GEO value is AI engine citability.

Run `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Run `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npm run build` — build succeeds. Inspect `marketing/out/cofounder/index.html` and confirm it contains TWO `application/ld+json` script tags: one with `@type: "SoftwareApplication"` and one with `@type: "FAQPage"` containing a `mainEntity` array. Verify the FAQPage mainEntity items match the visible FAQ content in the page HTML.
  </verify>
  <done>cofounder/page.tsx contains both SoftwareApplication and FAQPage JSON-LD script tags. The FAQPage references the same cofounderFaqs array used by the visible FAQ UI. Build succeeds. The built cofounder/index.html contains valid FAQPage structured data with mainEntity array of Question/Answer objects.</done>

1. `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
2. `cd /Users/vladcortex/co-founder/marketing && npm run build` succeeds (note: postbuild validate-jsonld.mjs will fail because it does not yet expect FAQPage on cofounder — this is expected and will be fixed in Plan 02)
3. Inspect built HTML: `grep -c "FAQPage" marketing/out/cofounder/index.html` returns 1+
4. The /cofounder page HTML contains visible "What is Co-Founder.ai?" H2 heading
5. The /cofounder page HTML contains visible FAQ accordion items matching the JSON-LD content
6. All content positions Co-Founder against hiring a CTO/agency, not against no-code builders

NOTE: The build may fail at the validate-jsonld.mjs step because it does not yet know about FAQPage on cofounder/index.html. If this happens, temporarily skip validation or handle the error. Plan 02 updates validate-jsonld.mjs to expect FAQPage on both pages.
