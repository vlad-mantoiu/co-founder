<objective>
Visually verify all Phase 23 performance changes across the marketing site: hero fade speed, font loading, reduced-motion behavior, and below-fold animation preservation.

Purpose: Human verification that the CSS-based hero fade, font-display: block, and reduced-motion experience meet product requirements before marking Phase 23 complete.
Output: Verified performance baseline with human approval.

Build the marketing site and serve locally for human verification:
```bash
cd marketing && npm run build && npx serve out -l 3000
```

Present the following verification checklist to the user for visual confirmation of all Phase 23 changes.
  </action>
  <verify>
**Step 1 — Hero fade verification (all 6 pages):**
Visit each URL and verify the hero headline appears almost instantly (100-200ms fade, not the old 700ms Framer Motion delay). The subheading and CTA should appear a split-second after the headline (stagger effect).

1. http://localhost:3000 — Homepage hero "Insourced AI for Founders Who Need to Ship Faster."
2. http://localhost:3000/cofounder — Co-Founder hero "Ship Faster Without Giving Away Founder Equity"
3. http://localhost:3000/pricing — Pricing hero "Pricing for Your AI Technical Co-Founder"
4. http://localhost:3000/about — About hero "Every Founder Deserves a Technical Co-Founder"
5. http://localhost:3000/contact — Contact hero "Get in Touch"
6. http://localhost:3000/cofounder/how-it-works — How It Works hero "How does Co-Founder.ai take you from idea to deployment?"

Expected: Each hero fades in quickly. No jarring delay before content appears.

**Step 2 — Terminal animation (/cofounder only):**
Scroll down on http://localhost:3000/cofounder to see the terminal mockup. The terminal lines should still type in one by one with the cursor blinking. This animation uses Framer Motion and should be unchanged.

**Step 3 — Below-fold animation verification:**
Scroll down on any page. The below-fold sections should still animate in (fade up) as they enter the viewport. Test on:
- http://localhost:3000 (Flagship Product card, Product Suite cards, Bottom CTA)
- http://localhost:3000/cofounder (Comparison table, Feature grid, Testimonials)

Expected: Scroll-triggered animations work exactly as before.

**Step 4 — Font loading:**
Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) on http://localhost:3000. The text should NOT flash with a system font and then swap to Space Grotesk. Instead, there may be a very brief blank before text appears in the correct font.

**Step 5 — Reduced motion (macOS):**
1. Open System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Reduce Motion (enable it)
2. Hard refresh http://localhost:3000
3. Verify: The logo ticker (horizontal scrolling bar under the hero on /cofounder) should be stopped
4. Verify: Below-fold sections should cross-fade in (opacity only, no sliding/bouncing)
5. Verify: Hover over buttons and cards — hover effects (scale, color change, shadow) should still work
6. Disable "Reduce Motion" when done

**Step 6 — Marquee ticker (/cofounder):**
Visit http://localhost:3000/cofounder and check the integration logos ticker scrolls horizontally. With Reduce Motion OFF, it should scroll. With Reduce Motion ON, it should be static.
