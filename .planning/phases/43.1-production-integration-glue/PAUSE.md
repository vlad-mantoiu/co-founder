# Pause: Phase 43.1 Discuss-Phase

**Paused:** 2026-02-27
**Workflow:** /gsd:discuss-phase 43.1
**Step:** discuss_areas (step 5) — gray areas selected, no questions asked yet

## Selected Gray Areas (all 4)

1. **GenerationService rewrite scope** — How much of execute_build() changes? New method vs modify existing? What happens to old RunnerReal path?
2. **Context assembly strategy** — Where do idea_brief + understanding_qna get loaded from DB? Who instantiates services?
3. **501 gate removal approach** — Remove entirely or replace with readiness check? Feature flag behavior after shipping?
4. **E2E test depth** — Mock E2B or real? Minimum E2E that proves pipeline works?

## What Was Completed This Session

- Phase 43 (Token Budget + Sleep/Wake Daemon): planned, executed (4 plans, 3 waves), verified (8/8 must-haves)
- Milestone v0.1 audit: 11/15 requirements satisfied, 4 gaps found (all integration glue)
- Phase 43.1 created as gap closure phase in roadmap
- discuss-phase 43.1 started, gray areas selected

## Resume With

```
