<objective>
Verify the complete end-to-end flow works: user completes Understanding, artifacts auto-generate, walkthrough guides user through results, and all 3 artifact pages display real personalized content.

Purpose: This phase exists because the core product flow was broken — artifacts weren't generated from real data. This checkpoint confirms the fix works from the user's perspective.

Output: Human verification that the complete flow works.

  <action>
    Human verification checkpoint. What was built:
    Complete end-to-end flow from Understanding Interview through artifact generation to personalized display:
    1. Backend: 3 new artifact types (strategy_graph, mvp_timeline, app_architecture) with Runner protocol methods
    2. Backend: Auto-trigger from finalize_interview with 3x silent retry
    3. Backend: Generation status polling endpoint
    4. Frontend: Strategy page with anchor nodes (user's words) and strategy nodes
    5. Frontend: Timeline page with personalized MVP milestones
    6. Frontend: Architecture page with tech stack and cost estimates
    7. Frontend: Generation progress overlay with step-by-step updates
    8. Frontend: Guided walkthrough revealing artifacts one by one
  </action>
  <verify>
    Start the app locally (backend + frontend). Use RunnerFake for deterministic testing.

    1. Navigate to an existing project Understanding page (or start fresh: Onboarding then Understanding)
    2. Complete the Understanding interview (answer all questions)
    3. Click Finalize
    4. VERIFY: A generation overlay appears showing step indicators for Strategy, Timeline, Architecture
    5. VERIFY: After all 3 complete, overlay shows "Your plan is ready!"
    6. Click "See your results"
    7. VERIFY: Guided walkthrough appears, showing artifacts one by one
    8. VERIFY: Strategy page shows amber anchor nodes + pink strategy nodes
    9. VERIFY: Timeline page shows MVP milestones with relative weeks and deliverables
    10. VERIFY: Architecture page shows component diagram with cost estimates
  </verify>
  <done>Human confirms complete E2E flow works: Understanding finalize auto-generates 3 personalized artifacts, generation progress is visible, guided walkthrough reveals each artifact, and all 3 pages display personalized content from user data.</done>

Human confirms complete E2E flow from Understanding finalize through artifact generation to personalized display on all 3 pages.

<success_criteria>
The core product flow works end-to-end: a non-technical founder can complete the Understanding Interview and immediately see their idea transformed into a personalized Strategy Graph, MVP Timeline, and App Architecture without any manual triggers. The "This AI gets my idea" moment is delivered.

After completion, create `.planning/phases/22.1-end-to-end-flow-strategy-graph-timeline-architecture-from-real-data/22.1-06-SUMMARY.md`
