# Phase 22.1: End-to-End Flow — Strategy Graph, Timeline & Architecture from Real Data - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Make the core product flow work end-to-end: user completes Onboarding, then Understanding interview, and the system automatically generates three personalized artifacts — Strategy Graph, Timeline, and App Architecture — using real data extracted and parsed from the user's actual Onboarding and Understanding answers. Currently, no complete end-to-end flow exists.

## Implementation Decisions

### Strategy Graph content
- Full strategic plan: combines go-to-market roadmap AND business model map into a comprehensive strategy visualization
- User's own words appear as anchor nodes (verbatim from their answers) with LLM-derived strategy nodes connecting them
- Primary emotional response: "This AI gets my idea" — the graph proves the system understood the user by showing their exact words validated and organized into a real plan
- Interactivity level: Claude's discretion (based on what's already built)

### Timeline & milestones
- Detailed MVP launch timeline as primary view, with a lighter long-term product roadmap section
- Relative durations (weeks), not calendar dates — user decides when to start
- Adapts both scope AND duration to the user's technical level and resources from Onboarding
- Each milestone lists 2-3 concrete deliverables — e.g., "Validation: 2 weeks — landing page, 50 signups, user interviews"

### Architecture artifact
- Two layers: high-level component diagram (Frontend, Backend, Database, APIs) PLUS specific tech stack recommendations for each component
- Simplified by default for everyone, with expandable detail for curious/technical users
- Include rough cost estimates — "~$50/mo to start, ~$200/mo at 1k users" to help founders budget
- Integration recommendations: Claude's discretion based on idea complexity

### Flow experience
- After Understanding completes: auto-generate immediately — no manual trigger, the magic just happens
- During generation: step-by-step progress — "Analyzing your idea... Building strategy... Creating timeline..." showing each artifact being generated
- After generation: guided walkthrough — step through each artifact one by one ("Here's your Strategy" → next → "Here's your Timeline" → next → "Here's your Architecture")
- Error handling: retry silently up to 3 times — user never sees the failure unless all retries fail

### Claude's Discretion
- Strategy Graph interactivity level (read-only vs light editing)
- Integration recommendations scope (based on idea complexity)
- Technical detail in expandable architecture sections

## Specific Ideas

- The Strategy Graph should make the user feel "This AI gets my idea" — their exact words from Onboarding/Understanding appear as anchor nodes in the graph
- Timeline adjusts both scope and duration based on who the founder is — non-technical founder gets smaller MVP scope AND longer build phases
- Architecture includes cost estimates to help non-technical founders budget realistically
- Guided walkthrough after generation — don't dump all 3 artifacts at once, reveal them one by one with context
