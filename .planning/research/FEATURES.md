## Context: What Already Exists

Before mapping new features, the current build page already ships the following. Do not rebuild these.

| Component | Location | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `BuildProgressBar` — 6-stage stepper (queued → starting → scaffold → code → deps → checks → ready) | `frontend/src/components/build/BuildProgressBar.tsx` | COMPLETE |
| `BuildLogPanel` — collapsed "Technical details" toggle with raw SSE log streaming | `frontend/src/components/build/BuildLogPanel.tsx` | COMPLETE |
| `AutoFixBanner` — shows debugger retry attempt number | `frontend/src/components/build/AutoFixBanner.tsx` | COMPLETE |
| `BuildSummary` + `PreviewPane` — iframe at completion with sandbox pause/resume/expiry UX | `frontend/src/components/build/BuildSummary.tsx`, `PreviewPane.tsx` | COMPLETE |
| `BuildFailureCard` — error summary + debug_id + retry CTA | `frontend/src/components/build/BuildFailureCard.tsx` | COMPLETE |
| `useBuildProgress` — polling every 5s via `/api/generation/{job_id}/status` | `frontend/src/hooks/useBuildProgress.ts` | COMPLETE |
| `useBuildLogs` — SSE ReadableStream for raw log lines (stdout/stderr/system) | `frontend/src/hooks/useBuildLogs.ts` | COMPLETE |
| SSE stream at `/api/generation/{job_id}/logs` | `backend/app/queue/` | COMPLETE |
| Confetti on success, cancel button with AlertDialog | `build/page.tsx` | COMPLETE |

The v0.6 milestone adds a **three-panel layout** replacing the current narrow single-column view. The five research domains below cover only what is new.

## Feature Landscape

### Feature Domain 1: Real-Time Build Narration (Human-Readable Agent Activity)

#### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependency on Existing |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| Human-readable stage sentences | "Setting up your project structure" not "scaffold" — non-technical founders cannot parse technical stage names | LOW | Extends `STAGE_LABELS` in `useBuildProgress.ts`; new narration text added to SSE payload |
| Visible current action description | NN/g (HIGH confidence): without per-step descriptions, users assume crash after ~10s of spinner | LOW | New SSE event field: `narration.text`, shown prominently above activity feed |
| Chronological activity feed | Smashing Magazine 2026 / aiuxpatterns.com (MEDIUM confidence): agentic UX requires an audit trail of agent steps — audit trail is what makes an agent credible vs opaque | MEDIUM | Replaces collapsed `BuildLogPanel` as the primary visible element during build; log panel moves to inner "Advanced" toggle |
| Jargon-free language | Target user is non-technical — "Writing your authentication flow" not "Running eslint --fix on auth.ts:47" | LOW | Claude prompt wrapping narration generation |
| Per-stage completion confirmation | Users need an explicit "Stage X done" signal — ambiguity during multi-minute stages causes anxiety (NN/g verified) | LOW | SSE `build.stage.completed` event (new event type) |

#### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Narration generated by Claude (not template strings) | Dynamic, idea-specific narration ("Building your Stripe checkout for SaaS billing") vs generic ("Implementing payment module") — makes founders feel the AI understands their specific product | MEDIUM | Separate Claude API call per stage; result stored in Redis, emitted via SSE `narration.updated` event; ~100-200 tokens per narration line |
| "What's happening right now" one-liner | Single prominent sentence above activity feed showing live action; updates when each narration event arrives — more scannable than reading a list | LOW | Derived from latest `narration.updated` SSE event; no additional backend work beyond narration generation |
| Agent persona voice | Narration in first-person co-founder voice: "I'm setting up your database schema so your data is organized from day one" rather than passive system log | LOW | Prompt engineering only; no infra change |
| Per-stage time estimate | "This stage typically takes 2 minutes" displayed at stage start — sets expectations, directly reduces anxiety at the point it is highest | LOW | Static lookup table keyed on stage name; no LLM call needed |

#### Anti-Features

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Raw error traces in narration feed | Founders want full transparency | Exposes internal file paths, stack traces, and any secrets in environment variables — security + UX problem for non-technical audience | Show sanitized "Something unexpected happened — auto-fix is running" with debug_id reference only |
| Real-time token streaming in activity feed | Feels alive and fast | Creates cognitive chaos — founder reads incomplete sentences that overwrite themselves; no useful information density from partial tokens | Emit complete narration sentences only, not streaming tokens |
| Per-file-change events in activity feed | Maximum transparency | LangGraph writes hundreds of files — one event per file floods the feed with meaningless noise | Aggregate: one narration event per agent stage transition only |

---

### Feature Domain 2: Live Screenshot / Preview Updates During Build

#### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependency on Existing |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| At least one preview screenshot before build completes | Lovable, v0, Bolt all show a live preview pane — founders expect something visual during build, not just text for 4-5 minutes | HIGH | Requires new: Playwright-in-sandbox or E2B Desktop; S3 upload path; SSE `snapshot.updated` event; frontend image display in center panel |
| Screenshot stored in S3, served via CloudFront | Screenshots must survive browser refresh and be available in the completion state | MEDIUM | Existing S3 + CloudFront infrastructure; new bucket path `/snapshots/{job_id}/stage-{name}.png` |
| Frontend receives SSE event when snapshot is ready | Founder sees screenshot appear in center panel when captured — not polling | LOW | New SSE event `snapshot.updated` with `{ url, stage, captured_at }` |
| Loading/placeholder state in center panel | Panel must not show an empty box while first screenshot is being captured (can take 30-60s) | LOW | Skeleton shimmer in center panel until first `snapshot.updated` event arrives |

#### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Screenshot per completed stage (not just final) | Shows the product evolving — scaffold stage can show a placeholder or directory confirmation, code stage shows first rendered UI, deps stage shows styled app — founder sees tangible progression | HIGH | One screenshot after each `stage.completed` event; 4-5 screenshots total per build; crossfade between them |
| Crossfade animation between snapshots | Smooth visual evolution feels premium vs jarring jump cut between screenshots | LOW | CSS `transition: opacity 0.4s` on `<img>` src change |
| Screenshot captured from running dev server | Actual browser render of the app at `localhost:3000` rather than a terminal output — shows real UI that the founder will preview | HIGH | Playwright installed inside E2B sandbox during scaffold stage; `page.screenshot()` after `localhost:3000` is live; upload bytes to S3 |
| Fallback to terminal screenshot if Playwright fails | Build must never block on screenshot failure | LOW | Try Playwright `page.screenshot()`; on exception, use `scrot` of the terminal output; upload whichever succeeds; if both fail, skip and continue build |

#### Anti-Features

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Live video stream of sandbox desktop | Maximum transparency | E2B Desktop screenshot API returns `bytearray` per call — not a video stream; streaming video would require WebRTC or WebSocket video frames which is a separate infrastructure problem disproportionate to the value | Periodic screenshots at stage completion events only |
| Screenshot every N seconds (time-based) | Shows constant activity | Most seconds nothing visually changes — creates noise, wastes S3 writes, adds polling complexity | Trigger on `stage.completed` event only; one midpoint screenshot for stages estimated >90 seconds |
| Founder clicking into sandbox via VNC/remote desktop | Power user transparency | Destroys the "your engineering team is building it" framing; non-technical founders will panic seeing a terminal; security risk | Keep sandbox opaque during build; iframe preview only after completion |

**Implementation decision (HIGH confidence):** E2B provides two sandbox types. The standard `e2b` sandbox (currently in use) runs code but has no display. The `e2b-desktop` sandbox provides Xfce desktop with Xvfb and supports `desktop.screenshot()` returning `bytearray`. Switching to `e2b-desktop` would require changing sandbox type and rebuilding the sandbox init. The lower-risk alternative: install Playwright (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`) inside the existing standard E2B sandbox during the scaffold stage, and call Playwright as a subprocess to screenshot `localhost:3000` after the dev server is confirmed live. This preserves the existing sandbox type and lifecycle.

### Feature Domain 3: Auto-Generated End-User Documentation During Build

#### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependency on Existing |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| "How to use your app" guide generated by build completion | Founders expect a tangible deliverable they can share with first users — a completion state with only a preview URL and no docs feels incomplete | MEDIUM | New Claude API call using Idea Brief + build metadata; result stored as new artifact type |
| Documentation visible in right panel during/after build | Three-panel layout (specified in milestone) — right panel must show content during and after build | LOW | New SSE event `documentation.updated` with Markdown content; frontend renders with `react-markdown` |
| Progressive generation — sections appear as Claude writes them | Non-technical founders need instant gratification — waiting for a full doc before showing anything converts wait time into frustration | MEDIUM | Stream Claude response into SSE `documentation.updated` events; emit one event per section completed |
| Content is founder-safe — no code, no CLI commands | Target user is non-technical — "Click Settings > Billing > Add Card" not `curl -X POST /api/payments` | LOW | Claude prompt constraint; adversarial prompt test cases needed |

#### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Documentation generated in parallel with build, not after | Founder reads docs while the build is still running — converts dead wait time into productive reading time; doc is ready the moment build completes | MEDIUM | Trigger doc generation from Idea Brief data at `scaffold.completed` event (Idea Brief exists before build starts; no code needed to generate user docs) |
| Downloadable PDF at completion | Matches existing artifact export pattern (WeasyPrint already in stack); founders want a tangible file to share with advisors or investors | MEDIUM | Re-use existing WeasyPrint PDF pipeline; new document type "End-User Guide" |
| Sections appear in order: Overview → Features → Getting Started → FAQ | Progressive disclosure — overview arrives in ~15s, full doc completes as build finishes | LOW | Claude structured output with section delimiters; emit SSE event per section |
| Documentation tied to specific build version | If founder rebuilds, they get a new doc version — prevents stale docs from mismatching current app | LOW | Store with `build_version` field; existing versioning pattern from artifact pipeline applies |

#### Anti-Features

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Technical architecture docs for founders | Seems comprehensive | Non-technical founders cannot use architecture docs; adds cognitive overload; Architecture artifact already exists for technical advisors | Keep Architecture artifact separate (already exists in artifact pipeline); End-User Guide is strictly user-facing "how to use your app" |
| Editable docs during active generation | Founders want to customize from the start | Editing a streaming document creates race conditions and confusing UX when Claude overwrites edits | Allow editing only after build completes and documentation is finalized |
| API reference docs | Completeness | Generated MVP has no public API in v0.6 scope; out of scope per PROJECT.md | Defer to future milestone when GitHub push and public APIs are added |

---

### Feature Domain 4: Long-Build Reassurance Patterns

#### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependency on Existing |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| Time elapsed counter | NN/g (HIGH confidence): users need to know a process has not frozen — elapsed time is minimum viable reassurance for any operation >10 seconds | LOW | `Date.now()` minus `buildStartedAt` from first SSE event; display as "3m 42s elapsed" |
| Per-stage time estimate | NN/g: "percent-done or time remaining" required for operations >10 seconds; stage durations are known from historical data | LOW | Static lookup: scaffold ~30s, code ~3-5 min, deps ~1-2 min; display "~2 min remaining" at stage start |
| Progress animation that is not just a spinner | Static spinner is the weakest possible reassurance — something that visually changes over time maintains engagement | LOW | Animated progress pulse on current stage in stage bar; rotating tip in activity feed |
| 2-minute threshold message | NN/g (HIGH confidence): 2 minutes is the threshold where users begin to abandon if given no explanation | LOW | Frontend timer: if any stage exceeds 120s without a new SSE event, emit "Taking longer than expected — this means your app has more moving parts than average" into the activity feed |
| Tab-focus re-fetch on return | Already implemented in `useBuildProgress` — must be preserved in the new layout | ALREADY EXISTS | No change needed; `visibilitychange` handler in existing hook |

#### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| 5-minute threshold escalation | At 5 minutes founders are genuinely anxious — move from passive text reassurance to proactive offer | MEDIUM | Frontend timer: at 300s show modal "This build is taking extra time. Want us to email you when it's ready?" — triggers `POST /api/generation/{job_id}/notify` endpoint |
| Rotating "while you wait" insights | Shows the AI is building something meaningful — "Your app will have 3 API endpoints and 5 database tables" drawn from Idea Brief data | LOW | Extract key numbers from Idea Brief at build start; pre-generate 4-5 fact strings; rotate every 30s in activity feed |
| Active agent role display | At each stage, show which agent is active: "Architect is planning your database schema", "Coder is writing your authentication" — humanizes the multi-agent pipeline | LOW | Map stage name to agent name in a static frontend lookup; no backend change |
| Completion time displayed in success state | NN/g: success dialogs should show elapsed time — "Built in 4m 23s" — helps founders calibrate expectations for future builds | LOW | Track first SSE event timestamp to terminal state timestamp; display in `BuildSummary` |

#### Anti-Features

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Progress bar percentage | Seems informative | LLM-based build duration is non-deterministic — a "25%" bar that sits for 3 minutes is worse than no percentage; creates false expectations that erode trust when wrong | Use stage-based progress (6 discrete stages) rather than a fake cumulative percentage |
| Exact ETA ("Your build will be ready in X minutes") | Founders want certainty | LLM code gen is non-deterministic; any specific ETA will be wrong ~50% of the time; being wrong erodes trust faster than not promising | Use ranges: "~2-4 minutes remaining for this stage" |
| Auto-redirect when build completes | Feels responsive | Destroys the reveal moment — completion is the emotional peak of the experience; founder should see it presented, not be jarred by a redirect | Present polished completion state in place; never auto-redirect |

---

### Feature Domain 5: Build Completion States

#### Table Stakes

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependency on Existing |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| "Your MVP is ready" hero moment | Completion is the emotional peak of the founder experience — must feel like a celebration, not just a status label change | LOW | Extend existing confetti + `BuildSummary`; add hero copy and visual treatment |
| Live preview iframe | Already exists in `PreviewPane` — its absence would be a regression | ALREADY EXISTS | `PreviewPane` with sandbox pause/resume already shipped |
| "Open in new tab" prominent link | Founders want to share the preview URL immediately | LOW | Already in `BuildSummary`; confirm it is prominent and above the fold |
| Download docs button | Founders expect a tangible file to keep and share | MEDIUM | Links to generated End-User Guide PDF; requires Documentation feature (Domain 3) above |
| "What's next" CTA | Founders do not know what to do after build — need a clear next step | LOW | Prominent card: "Deploy your app" linking to `/projects/{id}/deploy` |
| Build version label | Sets context for future iterations — founder knows this is "v0.1" and more versions can follow | LOW | `buildVersion` field already in `useBuildProgress` state; display in completion header |

#### Differentiators

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Summary stats card | Quantified achievement: "Built in 4m 23s, 3 pages, 5 API endpoints" — founder can share this as social proof | LOW | Elapsed time from build timestamps; page/endpoint counts from build metadata if available; static fallback if not |
| Latest screenshot shown in center panel on completion | Three-panel layout persists into completion state — center panel shows the last captured screenshot; transitions to full iframe on demand | LOW | Layout state toggle: `building` vs `complete` renders different center panel content |
| Three-panel layout collapses gracefully on completion | After build, left panel shows full activity log (not live feed), center shows screenshot or iframe, right shows finalized docs | MEDIUM | Layout state machine: `idle` | `building` | `complete` — each with different panel content |
| Completion state persists on page refresh | Founder should share the URL and see the same completion state; no re-build required | LOW | Already implemented: `status=ready` is a terminal state detected by polling; no additional work needed |

#### Anti-Features

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Auto-start iteration on completion | Reduces friction | Iteration requires Gate 2 (Solidification Gate) — bypassing it skips scope creep detection, a core product value | Show "Ready to iterate?" CTA that leads to Gate 2 flow |
| GitHub push on completion | Power user request | Out of scope per PROJECT.md; GitHub integration is a separate future milestone | Show a "Coming soon" badge on a stub "Push to GitHub" button |
| Deploy to production on completion | Founders want a live app immediately | Production deployment is the Deploy Readiness stage — premature deploy skips important assessments | Link to Deploy Readiness flow, not direct prod deploy |

### Dependency Notes

- **Extended SSE stream is the single critical infrastructure dependency.** All four new feature domains emit new event types. This must be implemented first. The existing SSE endpoint at `/api/generation/{job_id}/logs` delivers raw log lines — new typed events (`build.stage.started`, `build.stage.completed`, `narration.updated`, `snapshot.updated`, `documentation.updated`) must be added alongside or on a parallel stream.

- **Screenshots require Playwright-in-sandbox, not E2B Desktop.** The current build uses standard E2B sandbox (no display). The pragmatic approach: install Playwright during scaffold stage and call it as a subprocess to screenshot `localhost:3000` once the dev server is live. This preserves the existing sandbox type, lifecycle, and all existing `E2BSandboxRuntime` code.

- **Documentation generation starts at scaffold.completed, not at build completion.** The Idea Brief exists before the build starts. Documentation does not require the generated code — it describes how to use the app based on the brief. Starting at `scaffold.completed` means the right panel has partial content while the code stage (longest stage) runs. This is the key UX win: founders read docs while building, not after.

- **Left panel replaces (not supplements) the existing `BuildLogPanel`.** Raw logs move to an "Advanced" collapsible within the activity feed panel. The feed itself shows narration events. This avoids two competing log UIs.

- **Three-panel layout has a completion state variant.** During build: left=live feed, center=latest screenshot, right=progressive docs. After completion: left=full activity history, center=screenshot transitioning to iframe, right=finalized docs with download button.

## MVP Definition (v0.6 scope)

### Launch With

- [ ] Extended SSE event stream — `narration.updated`, `snapshot.updated`, `documentation.updated`, `build.stage.started`, `build.stage.completed` — this is the foundation; implement first
- [ ] Three-panel layout component replacing current narrow single-column view
- [ ] Human-readable narration via Claude API per stage transition — complete sentences in activity feed, no streaming tokens
- [ ] Live screenshot after each stage completion — Playwright-in-sandbox, upload to S3, emit `snapshot.updated` SSE event
- [ ] Progressive end-user documentation starting at `scaffold.completed` — streamed into right panel as sections complete
- [ ] 2-minute threshold reassurance message in activity feed
- [ ] 5-minute threshold email notification offer (modal, not automatic email)
- [ ] Polished completion state: hero moment, elapsed time stats, download docs button, "what's next" deploy CTA
- [ ] Safety guardrails: narration strips internal paths and error traces; debug_id shown, not raw stack traces

### Add After Validation (v0.6.x)

- [ ] Changelog generation for v0.2+ iteration builds — only useful once the iteration cycle is built
- [ ] Per-build stats (page count, endpoint count) in completion summary — requires structured output from LangGraph runner
- [ ] Email notification backend endpoint — low priority if typical build stays under 5 minutes

### Future Consideration (v2+)

- [ ] Build history browsable list with version diff
- [ ] Shareable build completion permalink with screenshot embed and stats
- [ ] Video recording of build process (requires E2B Desktop sandbox type switch)

## Feature Prioritization Matrix

| Feature | User Value | Implementation Cost | Priority |
|---------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| Extended SSE event stream (infra) | HIGH | MEDIUM | P1 — blocks all other new features |
| Three-panel layout | HIGH | MEDIUM | P1 — milestone visual deliverable |
| Human-readable narration (activity feed) | HIGH | MEDIUM | P1 — core experience, replaces raw log |
| Live screenshots | HIGH | HIGH | P1 — visual proof of building |
| Progressive documentation | HIGH | MEDIUM | P1 — tangible founder deliverable |
| Long-build reassurance (2min/5min thresholds) | HIGH | LOW | P1 — safety net for slow builds |
| Polished completion state | HIGH | LOW | P1 — emotional peak moment |
| Changelog generation | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P2 — only after iteration cycle built |
| Build stats summary card | MEDIUM | LOW | P2 — nice-to-have |
| Email notification for long builds | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P3 — only if builds regularly exceed 5min |

## Competitor Feature Analysis

| Feature | Lovable (v2.0) | v0 (Vercel) | Bolt.new | Our Approach |
|---------|----------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Live preview during generation | Right panel iframe updates in real-time as code is written | Instant component preview (static generation) | Split view with live preview pane | Screenshots per stage; full iframe in completion state — E2B sandbox URL not stable mid-build |
| Agent activity feed | Chat-driven; shows diff preview before applying changes | None — loading state only | None — spinner only | Explicit activity feed with Claude narration, left panel |
| Human-readable narration | Minimal — shows file names being modified | None | None | Full narration by Claude per stage — differentiator |
| Documentation generation | None | None | None | Progressive End-User Guide from Idea Brief — differentiator |
| Long-build reassurance | No explicit patterns | No explicit patterns | No explicit patterns | 2min/5min thresholds + per-stage time estimates — differentiator |
| Completion state | Preview URL + share button | Component copy/paste only | Preview URL + deploy CTA | Hero moment + stats card + docs download + deploy CTA |

**Key observation:** Lovable, v0, and Bolt all target developers or semi-technical users who can parse file diffs and code. None generate human-readable narration or end-user documentation. These are genuine differentiators for a non-technical founder audience.
