# Requirements: AI Co-Founder

**Defined:** 2026-02-23
**Core Value:** A non-technical founder can go from idea to running MVP preview in under 10 minutes, making product decisions the entire way.

## v0.6 Requirements

Requirements for v0.6 Live Build Experience. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **INFRA-01**: S3 bucket (cofounder-screenshots) provisioned via CDK with CloudFront OAC and immutable cache headers
- [ ] **INFRA-02**: ECS task role has PutObject permission on screenshots bucket
- [ ] **INFRA-03**: SSE event stream emits typed events (build.stage.started/completed, snapshot.updated, documentation.updated)
- [ ] **INFRA-04**: screenshot_enabled feature flag in Settings toggles screenshot capture without redeployment
- [ ] **INFRA-05**: Settings include screenshots_bucket and screenshots_cloudfront_domain environment variables

### Build Narration

- [ ] **NARR-01**: User sees human-readable stage descriptions in activity feed (not raw stage names)
- [ ] **NARR-02**: Claude generates idea-specific narration per stage transition
- [ ] **NARR-03**: Activity feed displays chronological agent activity with timestamps
- [ ] **NARR-04**: Narration uses first-person co-founder voice
- [ ] **NARR-05**: Raw logs available under collapsed "Technical Details" section within activity feed
- [ ] **NARR-06**: Per-stage time estimates displayed at stage start
- [ ] **NARR-07**: Token usage per stage displayed in activity feed
- [ ] **NARR-08**: Safety guardrails strip internal paths, stack traces, and secrets from narration

### Live Screenshots

- [ ] **SNAP-01**: Screenshot captured after each completed build stage via Playwright
- [ ] **SNAP-02**: Screenshots stored in S3 and served via CloudFront URL
- [ ] **SNAP-03**: SSE snapshot.updated event emitted when new screenshot is available
- [ ] **SNAP-04**: Center panel displays latest screenshot with crossfade animation
- [ ] **SNAP-05**: Skeleton placeholder shown before first screenshot arrives
- [ ] **SNAP-06**: Screenshots below 5KB discarded as likely blank
- [ ] **SNAP-07**: Screenshot failure is non-fatal — build continues if capture fails

### Documentation Generation

- [ ] **DOCS-01**: End-user documentation generated by separate Claude API call during build
- [ ] **DOCS-02**: Sections appear progressively (Overview → Features → Getting Started → FAQ)
- [ ] **DOCS-03**: Documentation generation starts at scaffold.completed (founders read while building)
- [ ] **DOCS-04**: Right panel renders documentation as Markdown with section fade-in
- [ ] **DOCS-05**: Documentation downloadable as Markdown file at build completion
- [ ] **DOCS-06**: Documentation downloadable as PDF via WeasyPrint at build completion
- [ ] **DOCS-07**: Documentation content is founder-safe — no code, CLI commands, or internal architecture
- [ ] **DOCS-08**: Documentation generation failure is non-fatal — build continues if doc gen fails
- [ ] **DOCS-09**: Changelog generated comparing build iterations

### Long-Build Reassurance

- [ ] **REAS-01**: Elapsed time counter displayed during build
- [ ] **REAS-02**: Per-stage time estimates shown at stage start
- [ ] **REAS-03**: 2-minute threshold message if stage exceeds 120s without new events
- [ ] **REAS-04**: 5-minute threshold modal offering email notification
- [ ] **REAS-05**: Rotating "while you wait" insights from Idea Brief data every 30s
- [ ] **REAS-06**: Active agent role displayed per stage
- [ ] **REAS-07**: Completion time displayed in success state ("Built in 4m 23s")

### Build Completion

- [ ] **COMP-01**: "Your MVP is ready" hero moment with celebration animation
- [ ] **COMP-02**: Summary stats card showing elapsed time
- [ ] **COMP-03**: Download documentation button in completion state
- [ ] **COMP-04**: "What's next" deploy CTA linking to deploy flow
- [ ] **COMP-05**: Three-panel layout collapses to completion layout
- [ ] **COMP-06**: Build version label in completion header
- [ ] **COMP-07**: Completion state persists on page refresh

### Three-Panel Layout

- [ ] **LAYOUT-01**: Three-panel build page: activity feed (left 280px), live snapshot (center flex), documentation (right 320px)
- [ ] **LAYOUT-02**: Desktop layout at 1280px+ with graceful fallback below
- [ ] **LAYOUT-03**: Independent panel scrolling with min-h-0 on grid children
- [ ] **LAYOUT-04**: Layout state machine (idle | building | complete) with distinct panel content

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Post-v0.6

- **DOCS-10**: Editable documentation after build completes
- **SNAP-08**: Time-lapse playback of build progression
- **SNAP-09**: Snapshot comparison diff between iterations
- **COMP-08**: Per-build stats card (page count, endpoint count) from structured LangGraph output
- **COMP-09**: Shareable build completion permalink with screenshot embed
- **REAS-08**: Email notification backend endpoint for builds exceeding 5 minutes
- **ITER-01**: Founder can request changes to running app via text input
- **ITER-02**: System generates diff, applies changes, rebuilds sandbox
- **ITER-03**: Founder sees before/after comparison of changes
- **ITER-04**: Build history with rollback to previous versions
- **EXPORT-01**: Generated code pushed to GitHub repo owned by founder
- **EXPORT-02**: Founder can download generated code as zip

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Live video stream of sandbox desktop | Requires WebRTC/WebSocket video infrastructure — disproportionate to value |
| Real-time token streaming in activity feed | Creates cognitive chaos — incomplete sentences overwriting themselves |
| Per-file-change events in feed | LangGraph writes hundreds of files — floods feed with noise |
| VNC/remote desktop into sandbox | Destroys "engineering team building for you" framing; security risk |
| Time-based screenshot polling (every N seconds) | Most seconds nothing changes — wastes S3 writes, adds complexity |
| Auto-redirect on build completion | Destroys the emotional reveal moment |
| Auto-start iteration on completion | Bypasses Gate 2 scope creep detection |
| GitHub push on completion | Out of scope per PROJECT.md — future milestone |
| Production deploy on completion | Skips Deploy Readiness assessment stage |
| API reference documentation | No public API in v0.6 scope |
| Mobile-optimized three-panel layout | Desktop-only for v0.6; most founders use desktop |

## Traceability
